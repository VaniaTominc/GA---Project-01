// ! JavaScript

//   ++ Variables for HTML elements that we want to listen to with EventListener. 
//   ++ Don’t forget addEventListner
//   ++ Declaring global variables 
// ?   ~~ Use as many as possible so you don’t need to declare them each time inside a function
//   ++ An empty array called grid, where I am later going to add with push method divs. Like we did in a class. 
//   ++ An array with classes of walls stored inside that I can later append to a div that I am going to create inside JavaScript and than append to HTML.
//   ++ Creating my Бабушка and declaring her position with global variable
//   ++ Moving Бабушка? // ! DONE

// ?   ~~ When moving from one position to another, removing the class and adding it to the new position
//   ++ Food

//   ++ Enemy
// ?   ~~ Adding a class of enemy to HTML with JavaScript
// ?   ~~ Fixed position of enemy?
// ?   ~~ Enemy movement
